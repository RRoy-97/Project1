Premise:
During the peaks of Covid-19 cases in Australia, what were the changes in movements of Australians around their natural environments. 
Can we find any correlations between rising case volumes and these movements patterns? Can we use historical data to predict behaviour patterns should the next wave of Covid hit or to deal with similar future situations, such as other pandemics or natural disasters. 
Background:
In a hypothetical situation where there is a hypothetical national public transport provider for the whole of Australia.  Supposedly, like most companies they were hit hard in 2020 because they were being ill-prepared, and did not anticipate the reactions and behavioural responses to Covid by Australians and their governments.
This year in a bid to reduce operational costs and increase efficiencies, we’ve been tasked with determine what level of public transport services should we provide (by state) for Australia. But more importantly what levels of reduction should be put in place should we experience similar reoccurrences from that of last year’s trends.
Our aim is to apply what we’ve analysed from Covid and Movement data for the past 12 months and use that to forecast the need to increase or decrease public transport for every state in Australia.
Where we will be getting our data from? What format?
Kaggle - COVID19 Daily Updates. In CSV format.

Google - Community Mobility Reports. In CSV format.

Google API for heat maps.
What will be some of the things we will analyse and their visuals? 
* Charts showing peaks and troths of Covid cases by months.
* Pie Chart to show Total Covid Confirmed Cases
* Google Heatmap
* Time series to show movements increase / decrease by months for 2020
* Correlation heat maps  
* Relevant summary statistics modelling 
* Any applicable linear regression models and trend lines
